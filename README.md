#### bootstrap5 and css3 and ES6 and JQuery aside

in this project I tried to make everything work as single unit to reach the last dynamic level can made by leting everything can work or edited alone smothly without issue, also
every part in calendar is a single object and has it's service, class/modal and SQL mapper, also I tried as much as possible to make eveything can edited alone even styles, also secret tip, this app will add element_id for each slot or period you can look for ids and add custom style for some single elements to group them beside the main a lots of ways let you group elements with style using class or custom css with id and !important etc


# New Updates
1. adding new tool to add another type of reservation system which edit the slots dates one by one (1,2,3),(4,5,6)(7,8,9) and not (1,2,3)(1,2,3)(1,2,3)
2. this will create diffrent system for example normal calendars or reservation can handled in one slot perdate 
3. second type is like cenima or cafe that has main datetime event/period and contains many zero or many slots per events but all in same time so it always (1,2,3)

## create calendar

```php
function add_years_to_calendar($years,$start){
  $current_year = $start;
  
  for ($y=0; $y<$years; $y++){
    $current_year += 1;
    // add 12 months

    for ($month=1; $month<=12; $month++){
      // get days in the month
      $month_days = cal_days_in_month(CAL_GREGORIAN,$month,$current_year);
      for ($day=1; $day<=$month_days; $day++){
        $day_name = jddayofweek();
        $jd=gregoriantojd($month,$day,$current_year);
        echo jddayofweek($jd,1) . '<br />';
      }
    }
    echo '<br /><br /><hr />';
  }
}
add_years(2,1990);
```

if you still use static wordpress plugin for your resrvation system with static looking and static features you are must switch to the new tools instead of plugin for calendar
or reservation system you can have CalendarPress to create reservationBasedwebsite with secured login and signup system follow the rules to make it not hacked and prevent known types of attacks and not only prevent but get data about hacker if any
